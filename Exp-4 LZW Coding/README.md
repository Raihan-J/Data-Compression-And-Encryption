Aim: To study LZWcoding

Equipment/Software: Python codes and Colaboratory

Theory:

This is a popular variant of LZ78, developed by Terry Welch in 1984. Its main
feature is eliminating the second field of a token. An LZW token consists of just a pointer to
the dictionary. To best understand LZW, we will temporarily forget that the dictionary is a
tree, and will think of it as an array of variable‐size strings. The LZW method starts by
initializing the dictionary to all the symbols in the alphabet. In the common case of 8‐bit
symbols, the first 256 entries of the dictionary (entries 0 through 255) are occupied before any
data is input. Because the dictionary is initialized, the next input character will always be
found in the dictionary. This is why an LZW token can consist of just a pointer and does
not have to contain a character code as in LZ77 and LZ78.
The principle of LZW is that the encoder inputs symbols one by one and accumulates
them
in a string I. After each symbol is input and is concatenated to I, the dictionary is searched for
string I. As long as I is found in the dictionary, the process continues. At a certain point,
adding the next symbol x causes the search to fail; string I is in the dictionary but string Ix
(symbol x concatenated to I) is not. At this point the encoder (1) outputs the dictionary
pointer that points to string I, (2) saves string Ix (which is now called a phrase) in the
next available dictionary entry, and (3) initializes string I to symbol x. To illustrate this
process, we again use the text string si sid Eastman easily teases sea sick seals. The steps are
as follows:
1. Initialize entries 0–255 of the dictionary to all 256 8‐bit bytes. The first symbol s is input
and is
found in the dictionary (in entry 115, since this is the ASCII code of s). The next symbol i is
input, but si is not found in the dictionary. The encoder performs the following: (1) outputs
115, (2) saves string si in the next available dictionary entry (entry 256), and (3) initializes I to
the symbol i.

2. The r of sir is input, but string ir is not in the dictionary. The encoder (1) outputs 105 (the
ASCII code of i), (2) saves string ir in the next available dictionary entry (entry 257), and (3)
initializes I to the symbol r.
To understand how the LZW decoder works, we recall the three steps the encoder performs
each time it writes something on the output stream. They are (1) it outputs the dictionary
pointer that points to string I, (2) it saves string Ix in the next available entry of the
dictionary, and (3) it initializes string I to symbol x. The decoder starts with the first entries of
its dictionary initialized to all the symbols of the alphabet (normally 256 symbols). It then
reads its input stream (which consists of pointers to the dictionary) and uses each pointer
to retrieve uncompressed symbols from its dictionary and write them on its output stream. It
also builds its dictionary in the same way as the encoder.
