Aim :To find Compression ratio using LZ78

Requirments :Python 3.4

Theory:

LZ78-based schemes work by entering phrases into a dictionary and then, when a
repeat occurrence of that particular phrase is found, outputting the dictionary index
instead of the phrase.
Every step LZ78 will send a pair (i,a) to the output, where i is an index of the
phrase into the dictionary and a is the next symbol following immediately after the
found phrase. The dictionary is represented like the trie with numbered nodes. If
we go from the root to a certain node, we will get phrase from the input text.
In each step we look for the longest phrase in dictionary, that would correspond to
the unprocessed part of the input text. Index of this phrase together with the
symbol, which follows the found part in input text, are then send to the output. The
old phrase extended by the new symbol is then put into dictionary. This new phrase
is numbered by the smallest possible number.
The coding will start with tree, that has only one node, which represents empty
string.
